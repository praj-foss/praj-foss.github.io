My name is Priyadarshi Raj. I'm a computer science student and an open-source software developer enthusiastic about Game development, Linux and Functional programming. I'm that typical computer nerd so you'll rarely find me AFK, although occasionally I go out for cycling, street food and (_ugh!_) classes. I hope you'll have a good time reading [my posts](/) or browsing [my projects](/projects).

I've been brought up by the Java ecosystem and I'm kind of a generalist in my technical choices. Writing beautiful code will always be a top priority for me. Also, I'm a staunch minimalist and a religious follower of [K.I.S.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), thanks to an early introduction of [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) during my high school days. Picking up favorites is always tough, although [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) is my language of choice and my favorite games are [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) and the entire [Souls Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)). It's so sad that Java couldn't succeed much in game industry outside Minecraft, but I'm hoping to change this scenario one day.
