#### [TerasologyLauncher](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher)

Terasology Launcher is the official launcher for the open-source game Terasology. It provides easy access to the different game versions and build types. Terasology and related projects are developed by a group of software enthusiast volunteers under the organization name MovingBlocks. I've been working on this launcher since [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6197056140476416/). It's built using JavaFX and supports all major desktop operating systems.

#### [Municipal Solid Waste Management System](https://github.com/praj-foss/msw-management-system)

A software project for managing collection of municipal solid waste (MSW), created during my second year of B. Tech. It's a cross-platform desktop app built using Kotlin, TornadoFX, and H2 Database. It provides a concise GUI for handling CRUD operations on municipality data, and also has a dashboard with intuitive charts. The UI is fully reactive and updates the charts and tables if the database gets updated from another source. It can also generate PDF reports in a few clicks.

#### [Zimbra Mailbot](https://github.com/praj-foss/zimbramailbot)

An open-source Telegram chatbot that can fetch emails from any Zimbra account. It's written completely in Clojure and is built on top of [alwaysdata](https://www.alwaysdata.com/en/) PaaS. It's currently in pre-alpha stage under [active developement](/tags/Zimbra%20Mailbot/).
