It was probably the first time I received some Google-branded emails other than Google Forms stuff. May 7 was a day of celebration, kickstarting my journey into the open source world. Special thanks to [Terasology](https://terasology.org/) and all my mentors. <!-- more -->

My project aims to enhance [Terasology's launcher](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher) and its upcoming release will showcase my entire summer's efforts. You can have a look at my complete proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jrYIAPLGH1j2MyP5paTl_LtYkXXV63ku6cndgbDXD6g/edit?usp=sharing). By the way, it was my first creation using Google Docs and it turned out to be pretty neat. ðŸ˜‰

It's always recommended to start GSoC preparations early, but my case was otherwise. I started around half a month away from the registration deadline. Luckily, I had some previous experience in **JavaFX** that helped me understand the launcher well and improve my proposal accordingly.

Please do check out the [Terasology project](https://terasology.org/). It's an awesome game engine having a Minecraft-inspired voxel-based design, with great modularity and customizability.
