Whew! Probably got the highest number of crashes this week. ðŸ˜… I tried to do too many changes in the launcher's initialization phase got the code jumbled up, the main reason for my headache. <!-- more -->

The first PR included some significant changes to the _LauncherInitTask_ and the main class _TerasologyLauncher_ but since the code got messed up, I reverted all changes. Now I'm planning to break down those changes into smaller bits and push them via multiple PRs.

### New Settings UI

All the game and launcher related settings in a single page. All the components were connected with the respective ids and methods from the original _SettingsController_ class, so it inherits all the previous functionalities like saving to and restoring from the disk, validation, and correction.
