This was quite a terrible week for me. I had to be inactive because of some serious, untimely issues. I also had to shift to my college's city, as classes were about to restart. So there's no contribution to show in this update. I'll try to make up for the lost time in the upcoming week and take care of the package manager. <!-- more -->

Thanks for bearing with me all along.
