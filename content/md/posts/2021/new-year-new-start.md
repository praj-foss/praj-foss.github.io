Ladies and gentlemen, let me start with my best wishes for the new year. I hope you're as relieved as I am about the end of 2020. It's been a long time since I posted something and all the blame goes to this terrible pandemic. It's certainly impossible to summarise everything I've been through in a single post, but what's gone is gone. And here I am, back in action. ðŸŒž

There's a lot of significant changes in my life during 2020. We shifted from our old home in Bhubaneswar where we had been staying for more than a decade. I also managed to finish my 7th semester online, and words cannot describe how much it sucked. And towards the end of December, my laptop HDD crashed terribly and I failed to recover anything. Thus, I learned an important lesson in cloud syncing and went on to buy a new Samsung Evo 860 SSD, followed by a MEGA account syncing on my brand new openSUSE Tumbleweed setup. Here's the latest shot of my desktop:

Out of all my lost projects, one contained the Markdown sources for my blog itself. So the first thing you might notice (if you're a returning reader) is that I revamped my site. After several hours, I managed to reverse-engineer the entire website with the help of a friend. The [site repo](https://github.com/praj-foss/praj-foss.github.io/tree/12a9253e14ba544e0f22b3081871c195f6326e29) now contains all Cryogen configs, theme files, and Markdown sources besides the generated site under the `docs` directory. 

That's all for today, folks. Stay tuned for more blog posts. I sincerely hope that this year turns out better for both you and me. ðŸ¤ž
