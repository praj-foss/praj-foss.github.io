    <h2>Making Standalone Java apps</h2>
</div>
<div>
    
    <p>Back in high school days, I learned how Java programs could work flawlessly across different machines without the need for any additional compilation - <strong>Write once, run anywhere</strong>. One of our laptops had a 64-bit Ubuntu installed while the other one had a 32-bit Windows 7. I tested out on a few more platforms and realized one particular hurdle that constantly popped up: It was necessary to have Java installed beforehand, which most OSs didn't ship by default. So here's a post about how you could make your apps truly standalone.</p><!--more--><h2 id="bundling-a-jre">Bundling a JRE</h2><p>A bundled JRE would allow your app to run just as it would with a user-side runtime. Because of the flawless compatibility, this method is preferred by many popular desktop apps including JetBrains IDEs and Minecraft. Bundling a complete JRE has been the traditional solution for making standalone apps. There's also a variety of tools that will help you create a proper package using this method. However, it also produces the most bloated distributable, as you're bundling the entire runtime even if you use only a few parts of the standard library. Here are some of the free OpenJDK builds you can use for bundling:</p><ul><li><a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">AdoptOpenJDK</a></li><li><a href="https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/">BellSoft Liberica</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/">Amazon Coretto</a></li><li><a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/">Azul Zulu</a></li></ul><p>There aren't many significant downsides to this, other than bloating your package size. Gradle or Maven could also be easily configured to bundle a JRE along with your distributable ZIP. One of the goals of <a href="/posts/2019/introduction-to-terasology-launcher/">my GSoC project</a> was to bundle a JRE with the <em>Terasology Launcher</em>, so that it runs without hassle.</p><h3 id="customized-jre">Customized JRE</h3><p>Since Java 9, the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/jlink.htm">jlink</a> tool can be used to assemble a custom Java runtime based on your module dependencies. This would result in a minimized JRE with just enough modules to run your app perfectly. However, it's not available in JDK 8 or older, which still has a significant developer population. Nevertheless, jlink is your best bet for <strong>modern</strong> standalone Java apps that don't want any compromise with its massive ecosystem.</p><h2 id="helpful-tools">Helpful tools</h2><p>Manual JRE bundling is a tedious job, so here are some common tools that can help you create a standalone package for your apps. These differ by the supported package formats and platforms:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/libgdx/packr">libGDX packr</a>: CLI tool supporting Windows, OS X and Linux. Can minimize JRE 8 and older too.</li><li><a href="https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html">install4j</a>: GUI tool supporting Windows, OS X and Linux.</li><li><a href="http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/">launch4j</a>: GUI tool for creating Windows installer.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/mini2Dx/parcl">parcl</a>: Gradle plugin similar to <em>packr</em>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/fvarrui/JavaPackager">javapackager</a>: Maven plugin supporting multiple package formats like <em>deb</em>, <em>rpm</em>, <em>msi</em>, <em>dmg</em>, and <em>zip</em>.</li><li><a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/java-applications">snapcraft</a>: Creates snap packages that can run across major Linux distros.</li></ul><h2 id="other-solutions">Other solutions</h2><p>You could use a different runtime than the usual OpenJDK-based JREs. The closest one is provided by <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a> for compiling Java bytecode directly to native binaries, although it has certain <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/LIMITATIONS.md">limitations</a>. Another option might be to use <a href="https://www.ikvm.net/">IKVM.NET</a> for running on top of CLR. If you're targetting just Android or iOS, have a look at Intel's <a href="https://multi-os-engine.org/">MultiOS engine</a>. But you can rest assured that bundling a proper JRE will have no compatibility issues on desktops. üëçÔ∏è</p>
